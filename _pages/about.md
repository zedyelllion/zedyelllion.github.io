I am **always actively looking for research opportunities and collaborations**, especially in areas related to learning-based decision making and multi-agent systems.

### Research Interests
My research interests broadly include:
- Reinforcement Learning  
- Multi-Agent Systems  
- Learning-based Decision Making  
- LLM-assisted coordination and communication  
- Reliable and scalable AI systems

### Hobbies
Outside of research, I enjoy:
-  **Go (围棋)**  I am a AGA 6.0 dan player.
- 🏸 **Badminton（羽毛球）** I have been playing badminton since 2021 and consider myself between strong intermediate and early advanced levels.
